# CSA0492-OPERATING-SYSTEMS
 Create a new process by invoking the appropriate system call. Get the process identifier of the currently running process and its respective parent using system calls and display the same using a C program.
 Identify the system calls to copy the content of one file to another and illustrate the same using a C program.
 Design a CPU scheduling program with C using First Come First Served technique with the following considerations. a. All processes are activated at time 0. b. Assume that no process waits on I/O devices.
 Construct a scheduling program with C that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
 Construct a scheduling program with C that selects the waiting process with the highest priority to execute next.
 Construct a C program to implement pre-emptive priority scheduling algorithm.
 Construct a C program to implement non-preemptive SJF algorithm.
 Construct a C program to simulate Round Robin scheduling algorithm with C.
